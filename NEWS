Version 4.0.90 (git)

* URL expansion in Redirect statement

URL argument to the Redirect statement can contain references to
parethesized subexpressions in the most recently matched URL statement
of the enclosing Service.  References are of the form $N, where N
is the number of the parenthesized subgroup.  To insert literal $
sign, use $$.

* New statement: ACME

The ACME statement creates a service specially crafted for answering
ACME HTTP-01 challenge requests.  It takes a single argument,
specifying a directory where ACME challenges are stored.  It is
supposed that another program is started periodically, which checks
for certificates approaching their expiration, issues renewal requests
and stores the obtained ACME challenges in that directory.

The statement can appear in ListenHTTP block.

Example usage:

  ListenHTTP
    ACME "/var/www/acme"
    ...
  End

* ACLs

Access control lists (ACLs) allow you to make some services available
for users coming from certain IP ranges.  There are two kinds of ACLs:
named and unnamed.  Named ACLs are defined in the global scope, using
the following syntax:

  ACL "name"
     "CIDR"
     ...
  End

where ... denotes more CIDR lines.  A CIDR is an IPv4 or IPv6 address,
optionally followed by a slash and network mask length.  Named ACLs
can be referred to in Service sections using the following syntax:

  Service
     ACL "name"
     ...
  End

This service will be used only if the request comes from IP address
that matches the given ACL.

Unnamed ACLs are defined within the service itself, as shown in the
following example

  Service
     ACL
        "127.0.0.1"
        "192.0.2.0/26"
        "203.0.113.0/24"
     End
     ...
  End

Semantically they are entirely equivalent to named ACLs.

* Boolean operations over request matching directives

By default, request matching directives are joined with an implicit
boolean "AND".  This can be changed using the new "Match" directive,
e.g.:

  Match OR
      HeadRequire "Host:[[:space:]]*example\\.org"
      HeadRequire "Host:[[:space:]]*example\\.net"
  End

Match directives can be nested to any depth.

Any request matching directive (including "Match") can be prefixed
with "not", to invert its result (boolean negation).

* Alternative spelling for header matching/manipulation directives

For consistency, the following configuration directives have been 
provided as alternatives for existing header manipulation directives:

  Old name        New name          Where
  --------        --------          -------
  HeadRequire     HeaderRequire     Service section
  HeadDeny        HeaderDeny        Service section
  HeadRemove      HeaderRemove      ListenHTTP and ListenHTTPS sections
  AddHeader       HeaderAdd         ListenHTTP and ListenHTTPS sections

The use of new names is preferred.
